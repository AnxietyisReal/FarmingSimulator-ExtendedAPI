# FarmingSimulator-ExtendedAPI
This extends the current GIANTS' Farming Simulator Server API by fetching XML files over FTP. 

The URL path can be found at `your.api.server.ip:8095`, you can read any file that is visible in the current directory, e.g `your.api.server.ip:8095/environment.xml` which returns the contents of that file.
